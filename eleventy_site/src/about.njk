  <h1>About VLSI PD Lab (.site)</h1>
  <p class="lede">This test site is intentionally structured differently from the main `.top` site. It is optimized for fast loading, concise study sessions, and centralized metadata through Eleventy.</p>

    <h2>Why this version exists</h2>
    <p>The `.site` domain is used to test a lighter information architecture, centralized SEO, and a content model that is easier to maintain than many standalone HTML files.</p>

    <h2>What is different from `.top`</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Guide + track navigation instead of mirrored long-form pages</li>
      <li>Different titles, descriptions, and editorial summaries</li>
      <li>Minimal CSS and no heavy front-end JavaScript</li>
      <li>Eleventy-generated sitemap and canonical URLs from one layout</li>
    </ul>
  </article>

  <aside class="side-stack">
    <section class="panel">
      <h2>SEO note</h2>
      <p>Keep one domain as the primary production site. The `.site` version is a test bed for structure, speed, and metadata consistency.</p>
