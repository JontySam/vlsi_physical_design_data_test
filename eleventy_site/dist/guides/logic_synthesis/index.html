    <h2>Design context and scope</h2>
    <p>This page keeps the topic coverage from the original logic synthesis article (goals, stages, optimization, mapping, and checks) but recasts it as a handoff-quality guide for physical design learners who need to read synthesis results critically.</p>

    
    <h2>Coverage map for this lab note</h2>
    <ul>
      
      <li>What synthesis is trying to optimize and how timing, area, power, and DFT goals compete.</li>
      
      <li>Typical synthesis stages from RTL elaboration through optimization to final library-mapped netlist generation.</li>
      
      <li>Inputs and outputs: RTL, libraries, constraints, operating conditions, reports, and gate-level netlist artifacts.</li>
      
      <li>Logic optimization approaches including two-level and multi-level transformations and when they matter in practice.</li>
      
      <li>Technology mapping workflow: matching, covering, and library cell selection under constraints.</li>
      
      <li>Physical-aware and power-aware synthesis concepts, including why early optimization can help or hurt downstream PD.</li>
      
      <li>Pre-synthesis and post-synthesis qualification checks before handing off to floorplan and placement teams.</li>
      
      <li>Where synthesis sits relative to HLS and domain-specific flows in the broader EDA ecosystem.</li>
      
    </ul>
    

    <h2>What you should be able to explain</h2>
    <ul>
      
      <li>Describe the synthesis flow in terms of deliverables and decisions, not just tool commands.</li>
      
      <li>Identify which reports and warnings should block a handoff to physical design.</li>
      
      <li>Explain how constraints shape optimization behavior and why poor SDC quality produces misleading QoR.</li>
      
      <li>Recognize the difference between a synthesis improvement and a change that merely shifts complexity downstream.</li>
      
    </ul>

    <h2>Review checklist before moving ahead</h2>
    <ol>
      
      <li>Confirm library set, corners, and operating conditions used for synthesis are documented.</li>
      
      <li>Review timing, area, and power summary reports before looking at detailed violations.</li>
      
      <li>Check constraint coverage (clocks, IO delays, exceptions) and note intentional assumptions.</li>
      
      <li>Inspect major warnings: unmapped logic, inferred latches, constant nets, or black-box issues.</li>
      
      <li>Record handoff notes for PD: expected critical paths, high-fanout nets, and constraint caveats.</li>
      
    </ol>

    
    <h2>Common watchouts</h2>
    <ul>
      
      <li>A clean netlist is not enough; a weak constraint set can produce a formally valid but physically difficult handoff.</li>
      
      <li>Do not compare QoR across runs without checking whether libraries, corners, or optimization priorities changed.</li>
      
      <li>Aggressive synthesis cleanup can hide structural issues that later reappear during placement or CTS.</li>
      
    </ul>
    

    
    <h2>Self-check prompts</h2>
    <ul>
      
      <li>Why are constraints often more important than optimization switches in synthesis quality?</li>
      
      <li>What would you ask for before accepting a synthesis handoff into floorplanning?</li>
      
      <li>When should a fix remain in synthesis versus being deferred to physical implementation?</li>
      
    </ul>
